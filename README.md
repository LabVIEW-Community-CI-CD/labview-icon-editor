## 1. Overview

This repository hosts the **open-source LabVIEW Icon Editor** under an **MIT license**. Whenever **LabVIEW** is built for an official release, it automatically pulls the **latest** Icon Editor from this repo’s `main` branch. This means that **your contributions**—whether features, bug fixes, or documentation—can become part of **official LabVIEW distributions** (currently focusing on **LabVIEW 2021–2025**).

### Current Pre-Release
- **Green default theme** for testing (feel free to revert/customize!)  
- LabVIEW **2021–2025** version specificity is important for technical reasons within this editor’s packaging approach.

NI is eager to see **community collaboration** drive improvements, ensuring the Icon Editor remains robust and innovative.

## 2. Key Components

1. **Source Files**  
   - Entirely **VI-based**, enabling customizations and enhancements to the Icon Editor’s UI and functionality.

2. **PowerShell Automation**  
   - Built on [G-CLI](https://github.com/G-CLI/G-CLI).  
   - Handles build, packaging, and release tasks.  
   - Easily integrated into DevOps (GitHub Actions, self-hosted runners).

3. **CI/CD Workflows**  
   - [Build VI Package](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/actions/workflows/build-vi-package.yml)  
   - [Development Mode Toggle](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/actions/workflows/development-mode-toggle.yml)  
   - [Run Unit Tests](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/actions/workflows/run-unit-tests.yml)

These pipelines produce **.vip** artifacts so anyone can install and test changes in their **LabVIEW 2021–2025** environment.

## 3. Getting Started & Contributing

We welcome **code** and **non-code** contributions—everything from bug fixes and performance tweaks to testing `.vip` files or improving documentation.

- **Must sign a CLA**: For external contributors, we require a Contributor License Agreement before we can merge your pull requests.  
- **Steering Committee**: A group of NI staff + community experts steers features. If an issue is labeled "`Workflow: Open to contribution`," it’s ready for external work.  
- **Fork or Clone**: Start by forking (or cloning) this repo. Then pick an issue or propose a feature.  
- **Experiments**: If you have a **long-lived** or large-scale feature (spanning weeks or months), see [EXPERIMENTS.md](docs/ci/experiments.md). Experimental branches might require special approval before `.vip` distribution is enabled.

For more details on the standard process, see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 4. Feature & Experiment Workflows

### Standard Feature Workflow

1. **Check or Create an Issue**  
   - If you have an idea, discuss it on [Discord](#contact-discord) or open a GitHub Discussion.  
   - Once it’s approved, the Steering Committee labels it "**Workflow: Open to contribution**."

2. **Assignment**  
   - Comment on the issue expressing interest in developing the feature.  
   - The Steering Committee (or a maintainer) assigns you.

3. **Branch Setup**  
   - A feature branch is created.  
   - Fork + clone the repo, checkout the feature branch, implement changes.

4. **Build & Test**  
   - Decide between [Manual Setup](./docs/manual-instructions.md) or [PowerShell Scripts](./docs/powershell-cli-instructions.md).  
   - Our CI pipeline generates a `.vip` so others can confirm your feature works in **LabVIEW 2021–2025**.

5. **Pull Request**  
   - Open a PR referencing the issue.  
   - Sign the CLA if needed.  
   - The Steering Committee + maintainers review, test, and iterate.

6. **Merge & Release**  
   - Once approved, your changes merge into `develop` or a typical short-lived branch.  
   - Eventually, everything merges to `main`, ready for the **official** LabVIEW build cycle.

### Experimental Branch Workflow

For **long-running** or **complex** features, see [EXPERIMENTS.md](docs/ci/EXPERIMENTS.md). 
- **Docker VI Analyzer** & CodeQL run automatically on experimental branches, but distributing `.vip` artifacts requires NI’s **manual approval** (“approve-experiment” event).  
- Alpha/Beta/RC sub-branches are optional for staging within the experiment.  
- Final merges also go through the Steering Committee.
