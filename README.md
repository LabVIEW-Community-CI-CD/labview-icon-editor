## 📌 Overview

The **LabVIEW Icon Editor** is an open-source, MIT-licensed project that releases VI Packages with the latest community-driven features. When **LabVIEW** is built for an official release, it automatically pulls the latest version of the Icon Editor from this repo’s `main` branch—currently targeting **LabVIEW 2026 Q1**.

This means that your contributions—whether features, fixes, or docs—can ship with **official LabVIEW distributions**.

- 🛠 Built entirely in G
- ⚙️ GitHub Actions  orchestrate PowerShell-based CI workflows for testing, packaging, and publishing `.vip` artifacts
- 🔁 This project pioneered CI/CD pipelines, documentation, and foundational infrastructure that will eventually migrate to a centralized dependency repository so that it can expand along with other concepts (e.g. lvenv)

NI’s Open Source Program encourages **community collaboration** to evolve and improve this tooling that streamlines the way the LabVIEW community tests NI-governed features.

## 🌱 Feature & Experiment Workflows

### Standard Feature Workflow

1. **Discuss or Propose an Issue**  
   - Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/q4d3ggrFVA)

2. **Assignment**  
   - Once approved by LabVIEW R&D, issue is labeled [Workflow: Open to contribution](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/labels/Workflow%3A%20Open%20to%20contribution)
   - A volunteer comments on the issue in order to get assigned
   - NI Maintainer creates a feature branch and assigns the issue

3. **Branch Setup**  
   - Fork + clone the repo  
   - Checkout the feature branch and implement your changes

4. **Build Method**  
   - Choose either:
     - [Manual Setup](./docs/manual-instructions.md)  
     - [PowerShell Scripts](./docs/powershell-cli-instructions.md)

5. **Submit PR**  
   - CI will build and publish a testable `.vip`  
   - Reviewers verify and collaborate with you until it’s ready

6. **Merge & Release**  
   - Merges go to `develop`, then to `main` during the next release cycle

### Experimental Workflow

- Used for large or multi-week features
- Docker VI Analyzer & CodeQL run automatically
- Manual approval required for `.vip` publishing (`approve-experiment` event)
- Sub-branches for alpha/beta/RC are optional
